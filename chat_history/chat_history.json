        "content": "Based on the provided document, I can explain how a cooling tower works with flow.\n\nA cooling tower is a heat rejection system that uses evaporation to cool a water stream. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Warm, moist air enters the cooling tower**: This air is drawn into the tower through the fan, which is powered by a motor.\n2. **Hot water is distributed through the tower**: The hot water is pumped into the tower through a distribution system, which consists of pipes and spray nozzles. The spray nozzles break up the water into small droplets, increasing the surface area for evaporation.\n3. **Dry air is introduced into the tower**: The dry air is drawn into the tower and mixes with the warm, moist air.\n4. **Evaporation occurs**: As the warm, moist air rises through the tower, it comes into contact with the hot water droplets. The water evaporates, cooling the air and the water.\n5. **Cold water is collected**: The cooled water is collected at the bottom of the tower in a collection basin.\n\nIn terms of flow, the cooling tower uses a combination of air and water flows to achieve its cooling effect. The flow rates of air and water are critical to the performance of the cooling tower. The document mentions the following flow rates:\n\n* **Flow Rate (gpm)**: This is the rate at which water flows through the cooling tower. The document shows a range of flow rates, from 80.2 gpm to 119.5 gpm.\n* **OutFlow Rate: N/A**: This indicates that the outflow rate is not available or not applicable.\n\nOverall, the cooling tower works by using a combination of air and water flows to achieve its cooling effect through evaporation. The flow rates of air and water are critical to the performance of the cooling tower.",
